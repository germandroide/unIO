# unIO Language Project

Welcome to the official repository for **unIO**, an inclusive International Auxiliary Language (IAL) designed for the 21st century.

## About unIO

unIO aims to facilitate clear, direct, and respectful communication among all people, regardless of their native language, culture, or sensory abilities. It is built on principles of radical simplicity, absolute regularity, and innate multimodal inclusion (spoken/written and signed).

This repository hosts:
*   The official [unIO Specification V1.0](./unio_specification_v1.0.pdf) (The foundational document - **Upload this PDF to the repo!**).
*   The actively expanding unIO Lexicon (vocabulary) in the [`lexicon/`](./lexicon) directory (structured YAML files).
*   Discussions (via Issues) and community contributions (via Pull Requests) related to the language's development.

## Getting Started

1.  Read the [Specification V1.0](./unio_specification_v1.0.pdf) to understand the core principles and grammar.
2.  Explore the current vocabulary in the [`lexicon/`](./lexicon) directory.
3.  Check the [Contribution Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to participate.
